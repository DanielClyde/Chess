# Chess
By Jaxon, Danny, and Josh
## Cloning instructions
1. copy the cloning url from the main page
2. navigate to the directory you want to clone the repo to, enter this command:
  `git clone <url>`
3. open intelliJ and open the folder of the repo
4. at first, it will say there is no SDK set up for project. Go ahead and choose SDK of your choice
5. In the project structure, mark the src/ folder as a source (blue)
6. specify where the out folder will be in project structure(ex. /users/danny/projects/Chess/out)
7. Now it should run!

## Pushing changes
in order to keep things clean and minimize dependency and SDK conflicts between us, only add changes to src/ files to git.
when getting ready to add and commit changes. Always first do a `git status` to see which files have been changed. If there any file
listed that is not a src/ class that you edited (such as a .idea file or .project), add it to the .gitignore before adding and commiting your changes.
